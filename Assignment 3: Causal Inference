# Part I - Matching

**a) Identify the essential elements of the Rubin Causal Model in this context.** 
**Complete sentences not require. Cover at least 5 elements.**

- *Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)*: It must be only unit-level, 
there should be no 'runover' of the treatment effect to other units that are 
supposedly unaffected. This means that if person A receives the treatment, 
person B (who allegedly didn't receive the treatment) should not be impacted 
by person A receiving the treatment, whether positively or negatively. 

- *Unit-level Causal Effects cannot be directly observed*: Since it is 
impossible for one individual unit to live in both conditions, it is not 
possible to measure the treatment effect on the unit level. There are no 
individual level counterfactuals in this case, but this would be what their 
attitudes towards peace would be if they did not directly experience violence. 

- *No Causation Without Manipulation*: There needs to be a clear causal 'if' 
that is well-defined. There needs to be an obvious treatment that is specific 
and measurable. This includes defining the units clearly and not having a varied 
level of treatment across units. This means that the treatment cannot be 
something that is non manipulable like 'weight' or 'height'. In this case, the 
treatment is being directly harmed. 

- *Average Treatment Effect (ATE)*: The average treatment effect can be 
estimated by finding the difference between the outcome in the treated versus 
control conditions. In this context, this is the effect of direct harm on the 
sentiments towards peace. 

- *Assignment mechanism*: Oftentimes, the assignment mechanism which is used in 
these models are non-random. They are usually dependent on other confounders. 
The models can try and account for these confounders as much as possible to try 
and predict  true treatment effects. 

**b) Express the research question (from the ‘vignette’ linked above). Is it a **
**causal question? Does it pass Rubin’s standard for causal questions? Explain.**

- The causal question: "Does exposure to direct violence during the Darfur 
attacks affect subsequent attitudes towards peace?"

- This would, to an extent, be considered a causal question since there are two 
clear treatments (either exposed to violence or not) and the attitudes towards 
peace have been quantified. There are clear units, treatments and outcomes. 
- However, the extent to which is satisfies the SUTVA is questionable. There is 
definitely the possibility of spill-over effects in this case. Since being 
'directly harmed' might not necessarily affect one 'unit' in isolation, 
exclusivity cannot be ensured. For example, those nearby or related to a unit
who was directly harmed, may experience at least part of the treatment effects 
due to proximity to someone who was harmed. 

**c) Decide on the predictors you would want to control for. Justify your answer.**

- For this analysis, I have decided to control for "female", "village" and "age" 

- *Female*: As mentioned in the 'Sensemakr' package, there was a 
disproportionate number of females who were exposed to sexual violence during 
the attacks, so controlling for this will be important when trying to control 
for confounding variables whilst matching. 

- *Past Voted*: I have also decided to include whether the people had voted in 
the previous election. This is because those who had had a say in the previous 
election might feel more personally impacted by the events.  This may impact 
the attitudes that they had towards the violence. 

- *Age*: I have decided to include age as a part of this analysis too as the 
age of respondent may affect the impact that the violence had on their 
attitudes. For example, a younger person may be more impacted by the violence 
than an older one simply due to the proportion of their lifetime that the 
violence has occurred. 


**d) Perform propensity score matching without using the Ys. Be sure to estimate **
**ATT (no other estimand). Be sure to evaluate balance on every variable that you **
**consider to be an important predictor. What is the smallest (balance-metric) **
**p-value obtained? Does the matching result meet your balance standard? Explain.**

```{r propensity score matching}
#first, I would need to create a logistic regression to create a propensity 
#score model using the predictors above. The Y's in this case are going to be 
#the 'peacefactor' as this is our dependent variable. 
reg1 <- glm(directlyharmed ~ female + pastvoted + age, data=darfur, family = binomial)
summary(reg1)
darfur$fitted <- predict(reg1, type = "response")
#now to perform matching:
match <- Match(Tr = darfur$directlyharmed, X = darfur$fitted, estimand = "ATT",  M=1)
summary(match)
mb <- MatchBalance(directlyharmed ~ female + pastvoted + age, data=darfur, match.out = match, nboots = 500)
```

The balance on all the variables: 

- *'female'*: The balance on this variable improved a lot after matching. The 
pre-matching p-value was the lowest out of any of them (0.16084) and rises to 
0.26745 post-matching, this a strong p-value. This means that after matching, 
the 'artificial control group' has a more similar mean to the treatment group 
for the 'female' variable. 

- *'pastvoted'*: The balance on this variable did not improve after matching. 
While the standard mean difference decrease, the p-value decreased from 0.36437 
to 0.028763, meaning that the means of the groups are less similar than before 
matching. This means that they are less balanced than before. This could be 
because the co-variates did not make for a strong logistic model, there could 
have been an interaction between the co-variates which makes this a bad match. 

- *'age'*: This was the worst matching. The means before matching were quite 
similar and they were more dissimilar after matching. The p-value dropped from 
0.48417 to 0.028658, meaning that the treatment and synthetic control are even 
less similar after matching. This could show that age is not a valuable 
variable to use as a co-variate, since the distribution of this variable between 
the treatment and control are no longer similar. Or that there may be interaction 
between the other co-variates. 

Since the matching only really improved the balance on the 'female' variable, 
we could either remove the other confounding variables and seek out other 
potential confounds or we could try and matching using a different method. We
would ideally what these p-values to be greater than 0.05. 
Nevertheless, we will use this method for the next section and then move onto 
genetic matching. 

*e) Even if the balance result does not meet your standard, proceed to estimate the treatment effect, standard error, and p-value. Explain and interpret your results in a few sentences.*

```{r propensity score matching - adding the Ys}
#then, I will create a variable for the independent variable values
Y = darfur$peacefactor

#I will then rerun the 'match' function to include the Ys
match <- Match(Y=Y, Tr = darfur$directlyharmed, X = darfur$fitted, estimand = "ATT", M=1)
summary(match)


```
As shown in the results above, when the dependent variable is added in (the 
peace factor, which is a measure of pro-peace attitudes), the estimated average 
causal effect is 0.047516. This is a positive number, meaning that the effect of 
directly being harmed is likely to have a positive effect on the peace attitudes
of these unit. The Abadie-Imbens standard error is 0.021519, this 
shows the variation in the matching model. The p-value is less that 0.05, 
meaning there is a significant difference between the average causal effect 
between the treatment and control group. This means that, using propensity score 
matching, people who were directly harmed by the violence in Darfur are 4.75%
more likely to have higher pro-peace attitudes after the conflict, when 
controlling for their sex, previous voting and age. 

*f) Run sensemakr analysis (using the package, following the example in the vignette) on the matched data and discuss your results. (You must obtain your matched data.)*

```{r sensitivity analysis}
#this takes the indices for the matched treated and control units
matched_treat <- match$index.treated
matched_control <- match$index.control
#then, it iterates from the darfur data to create the matched data
matched_data <- darfur[c(matched_treat, matched_control),]

#creating a linear model to use in the sensemakr package
reg2 <- lm(peacefactor ~ directlyharmed + age + female + pastvoted, data = matched_data)
  
#the sense() function then runs a sentivity anlaysis, the kd= shows that a variable would need to be between 1-3 times stronger then the 'female' confounder. 'female' is shown as teh benchmark covariate since it is the strongest confounder.   
sens <- sensemakr(model = reg2, treatment = "directlyharmed", benchmark_covariates = "female", kd = 1:3)
sens
summary(sens)
```
The sensemakr package helps us distinguish the robustness value that would be 
required to reduce the average causal estimate previously found to 0 and the 
robustness value that would be required to bring the confidence intervals to 0, 
thereby reducing the estimate to not be distinguishable from 0 (at an alpha 
level of 0.05). In this case, this is only 5.21% and 3.18%, respectively. 

The coefficient for 'directly_harmed' is 0.03653311, which suggests that a one 
unit increase in being directly harmed increases the likelihood that this 
person will have pro-peace attitudes by 3.65%. This is statistically significant 
since the t-statistic is greater than 1.96 (5.38), which is the critical value 
for a significance level of 0.05%

This means that an unobserved (unmeasured) covariate would need to be able to
explain away only 5.21% of the residual variance on both the treatment and the 
outcome to be able to explain away to observed effect.

This can be explored further using the sensitivity contour plots. 

```{r sensitivty contour plots, echo= FALSE}
plot(sens)
```



Here, the x-axis shows the strength of association between the treatment 
(directly harmed) and the unmeasured confounders. The y-axis does the same for 
the outcome (peacefactor) and the unmeasured confounders. Here, the R2 values 
are very low and fall outside the contour lines. This suggests that the 
estimated effects would remain significant even when there is an unmeasured 
variable that is 1, 2 and 3 times stronger than the 'female' variable (which is the 
most influential of all of the chosen co-variates). 

*g) Repeat steps c-f (above) using genetic matching instead of propensity score matching.*
```{r genetic matching, echo = FALSE}
X <- cbind(darfur$female, darfur$pastvoted, darfur$age)
genout <- GenMatch(Tr = darfur$directlyharmed, X=X, estimand = "ATT", M=1, pop.size = 16)
mout <- Match(Tr = darfur$directlyharmed, X=X, estimand = "ATT", Weight.matrix = genout)
summary(mout)
mb <- MatchBalance(darfur$directlyharmed ~ darfur$female + darfur$pastvoted + darfur$age, match.out = mout, nboots = 500)
```
Using the same variables as the propensity score matching, this genetic matching
model seeks to match between treatment and control groups to acsount for 
biased treatment assignment. However, instead of using logistic regression, this 
model does this by using a 'natural selection' approach, where potential matches
are iterated over until the strongest match is found. 

As can be shown above, this yields higher p-values than the propensity score 
matching which was previously used. A solution was found by the 3rd generation, 
with an extremely high lexical fitness. 

The 'female' variable, in contrast to the propensity score matching, actually
improves the least. While the standard mean difference improves a lot, the 
p-value only moves from 0.16084 to 0.17955. This is still high enough to say 
that the two groups are statistically similar but isn't as high as the p-value 
for the other covariates. 

The 'pastvoted' variable is matched extremely closely between the two conditions. 
The p-value moves from 0.36437 to 1, which is a perfect match. There is no longer
any difference between the mean pastvoted in the two groups. 

The 'age' variable does not improve using gen matching, but is still well matched. 
The standard mean difference decreases drastically but the p-value moves from
0.48417 to 0.4311 (which is still a high p-value). This could be explained by 
the improvement in the KS value, which evaluates the difference in the
distribution between the two groups. This improves all the way from 0.84023 to 1,
meaning that after matching, the distribution between the two groups is the same. 
While the means might be slightly less similar, the distributions are more 
effectively matched. 

```{r genetic matching - adding in the Ys}
X <- cbind(darfur$female, darfur$pastvoted, darfur$age)
Y <- darfur$peacefactor

mout_ys <- Match(Y = Y, Tr = darfur$directlyharmed, X=X, estimand = "ATT", Weight.matrix = genout)
summary(mout_ys)

```

Adding in the Y-values can help us estimate the causal treatment effect. 

In this case, the estimated effect is similar to what was calculated by the 
propensity score matching. It reveals a positive realtions and it seems that 
exposure to direct harm increases the subsequent propensity for peace by 4.79%. 
The Abadie-Imbens standard error and p-value are also very similar to those 
found from the propensity score matching. 

The cross validation of these matching models helps demonstrate their robustness.
This can be further evaluated by using the sensitivity analysis. 

```{r genetic matching - sensitivity analysis}
g_matched_treat <- mout_ys$index.treated
g_matched_control <- mout_ys$index.control
g_matched_data <- darfur[c(g_matched_treat, g_matched_control),]

#creating a linear model to use in the sensemakr package
g_reg <- lm(peacefactor ~ directlyharmed + age + female + pastvoted, data = g_matched_data)
  
sens2 <- sensemakr(model = g_reg, treatment = "directlyharmed", benchmark_covariates = "female", kd = 1:3, q = 1, reduce = TRUE)
sens2
summary(sens2)
```
The coefficient found for 'directly-harmed' in this case is 0.03653311, meaning
there is a positive relationship between incidence of direct harm and pro-peace
attitudes. This is also greater than the critical value of 1.96 (5.376). 

An unmeasured and unaccounted for variable would have to explain away 5.69% of 
the variance in the dependent and independent variances (the direct harm and the 
peace scores) in order to explain away the observed effect. In order to make this
statistically insigificant, an unobserved variable (either 1, 2 or 3 times 
stronger than the 'female' covariate) would have to explain away 3.65% of the 
variance of the outcome variable (pro-peace attitudes). This can be investigated 
further using contour plots. 

```{r sensitivty contour plots - genmatch, echo=FALSE}
plot(sens2)
```
As shown in the contour plot above, even if an unobserved variable was present 
which was one, two or three times stronger than the 'female' co-variate, 
it would not be able to explain away the variance shown by the model or 
make the treatment effect 0. 

*h) Repeat step (g), but adding at least 2 additional predictors to your step (g) analysis. You may want to use interaction terms or quadratic terms for this.*
```{r genetic matching - adding additional predictors (genmatch), message = FALSE}
#adding an interaction term between age and sex
interact_agexfemale <- darfur$age*darfur$female
#adding this to the dataset
darfur <- cbind(darfur, interact_agexfemale)
#creating the co-variates and adding in house size as my second variable
X2 <- cbind(darfur$female, darfur$pastvoted, darfur$age, interact_agexfemale, darfur$hhsize_darfur)

#running a second genetic matching algorithm
genout2 <- GenMatch(Tr = darfur$directlyharmed, X=X2, estimand = "ATT", M=1, pop.size = 16)
```

```{r genetic matching - adding additional predictors, Match and MatchBalance}

mout2 <- Match(Tr = darfur$directlyharmed, X=X2, estimand = "ATT", Weight.matrix = genout2)
summary(mout2)
mb2 <- MatchBalance(darfur$directlyharmed ~ darfur$female + darfur$pastvoted + darfur$age + interact_agexfemale + darfur$hhsize_darfur, match.out = mout, nboots = 500)
```


For this analysis, I decided to add the interaction term between 'female' and 
'age' and the variable for house size. 

The interaction term here is based on the fact that younger females might be
more frequently targetted than older females, or vice versa. Investigating
the impact of this interaction could help strengthen the power of the model. 
This variable will only measure the interaction between age for women, since 
multiplying age by 0 (which is the binary indication for men) will yield a 
result of 0. 

I also decided to add the house size variable because this may have been a 
signal of wealth. Investigating the potential role that wealth plays in the 
potential of being directly harmed is important for this analysis. 

*Analysing the results* 
As can be seen above, a genetic matching solution was found by the 6th 
generation, in contrast to the first model where it was found in the 4th 
generation. This is likely because adding more covariates adds more variance 
and makes it more difficult to match. 

The previous three covariates (female, pastvoted and age) were all matched in 
the same way, with the same p-values as the previous genetic matching model.

The interaction term (female*age) improved after matching, with the standard
mean difference decreasing and the p-value increasing from 0.11173 to 0.19922, 
meaning the treatment and control distribution of the variables were more 
similar than before matching. The balance was improved. 

The house size variable did not improve from matching, and were was more 
balanced between the groups prior to matching. This can be seen by the standard
mean error increasing and the p-value decreasing from 0.2343 to 0.1907. This 
is indicative of the means between the two groups become more dissimilar after
matching. The KS p-value is much lower, meaning the distributions are much 
more diverse than they previously were. 


```{r genetic matching 2 - adding in the Ys}

#adding in the dependent variable for the second genetic matching model
X2 <- cbind(darfur$female, darfur$pastvoted, darfur$age, interact_agexfemale, darfur$hhsize_darfur)
Y <- darfur$peacefactor

mout_ys2 <- Match(Y = Y, Tr = darfur$directlyharmed, X=X2, estimand = "ATT", Weight.matrix = genout2)
summary(mout_ys2)

```
As can be shown above, this shows a higher treatment effect than my previous 
(4.79% versus 5.17%). This is positive, showing that the impact of treatment 
(direct harm) increases the likelihood of pro-peace values by 5,17%. 
This is increase in effect is potentially due to the addition of the interaction 
variable which captured more nuance in the sex variable, as women of certain 
ages may have been more impacted by the treatment. This result is statistically 
significant since the p-value is lower than 0.05. 


```{r genetic matching 2 - sensitivity analysis}
g_matched_treat2 <- mout_ys2$index.treated
g_matched_control2 <- mout_ys2$index.control
g_matched_data2 <- darfur[c(g_matched_treat2, g_matched_control2),]

#creating a linear model to use in the sensemakr package
g_reg2 <- lm(peacefactor ~ directlyharmed + age + female + pastvoted + interact_agexfemale + hhsize_darfur, data = g_matched_data2)
  
sens3 <- sensemakr(model = g_reg2, treatment = "directlyharmed", benchmark_covariates = "female", kd = 1:3, q = 1, reduce = TRUE)
sens3

```
The coefficient found for 'directly-harmed' in this case is 0.06874, meaning
there is a positive relationship between incidence of direct harm and pro-peace
attitudes. This is a higher coefficeint than any of the previously run regressions. 
This is also greater than the critical value of 1.96 (4.41509), and the standard
error is lower than previous regression. 

An unmeasured and unaccounted for variable would have to explain away 10.15% of 
the variance in the dependent and independent variances (the direct harm and the 
peace scores) in order to explain away the observed effect. In order to make this
statistically insignificant, an unobserved variable (either 1, 2 or 3 times 
stronger than the 'female' covariate) would have to explain away 5.77% of the 
variance of the outcome variable (pro-peace attitudes). These robustness values
are higher than any of the other sensitivity analyses that I have previously run, 
pointing towards the potential strength of this model. This can be investigated 
further using contour plots. 

```{r sensitivty contour plots - genmatch3, echo=FALSE}
plot(sens3)
```
As expected, this contour plot shows the greatest robustness out of any of the 
models previously investigated. The covariates are the furtherest away from the 
0 contour line, meaning that it is highly unlikely that an unmeasured co-variate, 
even 3x stronger than the 'female' co-variate could explain away the treatment
effect. 


# Part II - Synthetic Controls

I will be creating a Synthetic Control for Baleares (Islas) since my name starts 
with 'K'. The original data set was put together by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003)
and is made up of data from all 17 Spanish regions. Their original work 
intended to create a synthetic control using these other regions in order to 
estimate the impact that terrorist activity had on the economic growth of 
the Basque Country after the late 1960s. 

Since I have no clear research question or treatment in mind, this synthetic 
control will simply try to create a synthetic Baleares (Islas), using the  
region's GDP per capita between 1964 to 1969 to predict their GDP per capita 
between 1970 to 1997. 

```{r synthetic controls, echo = TRUE}

data("basque")
attach(basque)
dataprep.out<-
  dataprep(
   foo = basque,
   predictors = c("invest", "school.prim", "school.med", "school.high", "school.post.high", "school.illit"),
   predictors.op = "mean",
   dependent = "gdpcap",
   unit.variable = "regionno",
   time.variable = "year",
   special.predictors = list(
    list("gdpcap",1960:1969,c("mean")), 
    list("sec.agriculture", seq(1961, 1969, 2), "mean"), # data is available for every two years, from 1961 till 1969
    list("sec.energy", seq(1961, 1969, 2), "mean"),
    list("sec.industry", seq(1961, 1969, 2), "mean"),
    list("sec.construction", seq(1961, 1969, 2), "mean"),
    list("sec.services.venta", seq(1961, 1969, 2), "mean"),
    list("sec.services.nonventa", seq(1961, 1969, 2), "mean"),
    list("popdens", 1969,"mean")), # data is only available for 1969
   treatment.identifier = "Baleares (Islas)",
   unit.names.variable = "regionname", # Since I am using the name rather than the number so need to add unit.name.variable
   controls.identifier = c(2:4, 6:16,18), # Making sure to drop Spain (1), Baleares (Islas) (5), and Basue (17) out of the donor pool
   time.predictors.prior = 1964:1969,
   time.optimize.ssr = 1964:1969,
   time.plot = 1964:1994)

synth.out <- synth(dataprep.out)

```

```{r synthetical controls - tables}
synth.tables <- synth.tab(
      dataprep.res = dataprep.out,
      synth.res = synth.out)
print(synth.tables)

```
As can be shown in the tables above, synthetic Baleares (Islas) was composed of
2 main regions, the first being Cataluna with a weight of 0.575 and the second 
being Madrid with a weight of 0.394. 

These weights are all positive and add up to 1. This is important as it the 
synthetic control should not predict possibilities that extrapolate beyond 
results that have previously been recorded. 

The predictor which received the highest weight was the production of 
nonmarketable services sector as a percentage of total production, with marketable 
services being the second most influential predictor variable. This is 
echoed in the first table as these are the variables which are best balanced
between the two units. Variables like primary school education and level of 
literacy have not been as well balanced between the units. 

This can be further investigated by visualing the GDP over time, which can be
seen below. 

```{r synthetic controls - visualise}
path.plot(dataprep.res = dataprep.out,synth.res = synth.out)

```
The synthetic control model relatively closely mirrors Baleares's actual change 
in GDP per capita over time.  Initially, there's a small trend of overestimating 
GDP until around 1967, shifting to an increasingly growing underestimation of
GDP unti 1997. Although, the synthetic control does follow similar peaks and 
troughs and the real Baleares with a peak around 1974 and another around 1987. 
These can be investigated further by looking at the gaps. 


```{r synthetic controls - visualise - gaps}
gaps.plot(dataprep.res = dataprep.out,synth.res = synth.out)

```

This gaps graph above shows that there are relatively small gaps betweeen the real
Baleares and the synthetic control, but that the estimation is least accurate 
between 1980 and 1990 and becomes more accurate after 1990. 

Further analyses might look into the separate variables during this time period 
(for example by plotting the nonmarketable service during this time) to see
if Cataluna and Baleares were potentially outliers in these areas, which mighht
explain why this region was given such a high weight.
